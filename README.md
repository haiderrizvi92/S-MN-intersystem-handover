## S-MN-intersystem-handover
# 5G handover SDN based overview

Vehicle-2-Everything (V2X) communication consists
of mainly two types of communication, one is Vehicle to Vehicle
(V2V) and the other is a vehicle to infrastructure(V2I).V2X has
many uses including road safety that can help avoid collisions to
infotainment like traffic information, navigation, and multimedia.
As the driver assistance systems are rapidly growing, user interaction
and acceptance of these systems has to be evaluated. The
aim of this work is to improve an already existing communication
model for V2X communication by minimizing the handover duration.
IEEE 802.11p has been a standard for V2X communication.
In IEEE 802.11p, due to high density, the data collision occurs.
So we replaced IEEE 802.11p with 5G SDN based approach.
Now the current communication simulation implements the X2
interface based Vehicle Unit Inter-system handover (VUIH)‚Äù in
a partially 5G SDN-based V2X communication. Our proposed
approach has achieved much better results than the baseline
results. We have optimized the preparation time of handover by
1.24ms and completion time of handover by 0.8308ms.
